# MOVIES

## Description üìë

Movies is a web application where users can explore popular movies and view details about them. The
application utilizes the [<b>themoviedb.org API</b>](https://www.themoviedb.org) to fetch movie
data. It features navigation for popular movies as the home page and a search page to find movies
based on keywords. Clicking on a movie poster leads to a detailed movie information page, which
includes embedded routes to view the cast and read reviews of the selected movie. Additionally, the
movie details page provides a back button that redirects the user to either the search page or the
popular movies page, depending on the previous navigation path. If a user shares a link, clicking
the back button will also redirect them to the popular movies page.

The application includes the following routes:

- `/` - Home component: The homepage displaying a list of popular movies.
- `/movies` - Movies component: The movie search page where users can search for movies using
  keywords.
- `/movies/:movieId` - MovieDetails component: The page providing detailed information about a
  specific movie.

  Rendered on the MovieDetails page.
- `/movies/:movieId/reviews` - Reviews component: Displays information about reviews of the movie.
